# Othello
Othello (also known as Reversi) is a well-known two-player strategy game. The game is played on a rectangular board divided into a grid â€” usually 8x8, though the size of the grid can vary. Players alternately place discs on the game board; one player's discs are black and the other player's are white. When discs are placed on the game board, other discs already on the board are flipped (i.e., a black disc becomes a white disc or vice versa). The game concludes when every square on the grid contains a disc, or when neither player is able to make a legal move; the winning player is generally the one who has more discs on the board at the end of the game, though there are alternate ways to determine a winner.
